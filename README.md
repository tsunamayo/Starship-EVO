# About

Build **spaceships** and wander among the **stars**!

**Starship EVO** is a voxel **construction** game set in a procedural **galaxy** made of billions of stars.

Play with your **friends**, use **blocks**, **bricks** and **paints** to create the **spaceship** of your dreams and discover a galaxy full of wonders.

The game offers to merge the **excitement of exploring** uncharted worlds as in Elite, with the **elegant and simple joy of building** of Minecraft.
